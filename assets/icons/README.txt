// Placeholder for icon generation
// In a real scenario, you would put actual PNG files here.
// I'll create a simple SVG to PNG converter or just use an SVG as a placeholder if browsers support it, 
// but for PWA strictness, I should ideally have PNGs. 
// Since I cannot generate binary image files, I will leave this empty and instruct the user.
